### What are the pros and cons of TDD?

Pros:    
  
TDD allows you to test one feature at a time, enabling the developer to ensure that each feature implemented has full functionality. Furthermore, this approach allows for the code structure to be more modular, allowing for bugs to be fixed easier as it narrows your bug search to a particular segment of the code. This approach also results in more reliable code as there are tests laid out to demonstrate its functionality. It also allows for better collaboration between teams as there is higher confidence between developers about the quality of code that is written. 

Cons:  
  
TDD works particularly poorly when it comes to large and complex codebases. For these types of codebases, it is hard to ensure that the developer can write enough test cases to cover every possible scenario for user interaction with the codebase. Furthermore, due to the size and complexity of the tests innvovled they would take a long time to run making it hard to run the tests at a regular frequency. TDD also makes the development cycle much longer and can increase maintenance costs.
